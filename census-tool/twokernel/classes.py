"""Boolean recognizers and numeric invariants for graphs and digraphs.

Every *undirected* flag is a property of the **underlying graph** of the digraph handed
in, so the same function serves a graph (given as its symmetric digraph) and a digraph.
Digraph flags read the arcs.

The empty digraph (``n = 0``) satisfies every flag vacuously except ``connected``.
