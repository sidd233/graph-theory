"""Graph and digraph generators.  All randomness takes an explicit seed.

Everything returns a :class:`~twokernel.core.Digraph`; undirected graphs are represented
by their symmetric digraph, as everywhere else in this package.

Exhaustive generation uses ``nx.graph_atlas_g()`` (all 1253 graphs on at most 7 vertices).
``pynauty`` is not available in this environment (its C extension needs ``Python.h``), so
larger exhaustive sweeps are done by direct structured encodings -- all orientations of a
graph, split graphs by clique-side neighbourhood multisets, DAGs by upper-triangular arc
sets -- and by seeded random sampling.  This is stated in FINDINGS.md.
